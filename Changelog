0f975f4 Fix to regression in last commit; wrong field name for homepage blacklist
390a2a8 Fix for Blacklist plugin: was saving an empty entry if blacklist was empty, which would match *all* possible nickname registrations, preventing all registration on mozilla.status.net. Now saving only non-empty lines, and only matching non-empty lines so we don't fail if we still have a bogus entry.
67b8b13 Fix keys / keyTypes for Blacklist plugin - was spewing notices for undefined array indexes when saving blacklist entries from admin panel
7bdea95 Fix to make blowing of replies stream cache more consistent when receiving replies. (Was being done at mail notify time instead of at save time for local replies; now moved to reply save time internally so it can't get forgotten)

efcdfab Ticket #2205: pass geo locations over Twitter bridge (will only be used if enabled on the Twitter side)
a21a172 Fix for "#foo !foo" in same notice failing during save, causing failout before distribution. Move saveGroups after saveTags when saving notices; groups may save additional tags, so need to be moved after so the check for duplicates actually works.

6274c39 In single-user mode, link #hashtags to the user's tagged stream rather than the global tag action, which isn't registered. Previously they would end up pointing to the home URL.

ecd3138 Fix for error during handling of HTTP error response case in Geonames lookups
8a02cad drop onStartShowHeadElements handler from MobileProfile; just duplicated the original code path, and after removing the bogus notice-spewing code it was running those things twice.
f255b36 Refactor installer into base class plus web and CLI installers. scripts/install_cli.php is a bit experimental at present but works.
aceaeb9 fixup_blocks.php: finds any stray subscriptions in violation of blocks, and removes them.
82326a3 show PEAR_Error message, not the object
f09e81f Made it so that settag would list tags.
d352e5f Handle attempt to subscribe a local user via their remote webfinger reference more gracefully. The ensure* family of functions will now return an OStatusShadowException in this case, which gives us a pleasant error message instead of a giant exception backtrace when you do 'sub somebody@this.local.server'.

cda03ff Set a default 2-second timeout on Geonames web service lookups. After a failure, further lookups in the same process will be skipped for the next 60 seconds (also configurable). Makes a Geonames outage much less disruptive to site operations.
7c3b320 Allow Meteor plugin to be configurable via configuration database or file. As there's no admin control panel yet, this is mainly meant for batch administration and using setconfig.php
3172b50 Add a User-Agent fragment blacklist to MobileProfile: sticking iPad on the regular theme, which works better on its larger screen (was tripped on 'mobile' in the UA though we had no explicit check for 'ipad' previously)
edea825 Comment out unreachable code spewing notices due to use of undefined variables in MobileProfile. This needs some cleanup...
3ac3bc3 Some localization cleanup and doc to aid in customization: * added locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/statusnet.po to make it easier to start customizing English texts * added notes to locale/README about customizing and how to disable languages you haven't customized * renamed PO templates from *.po to *.pot to match general conventions and reduce confusion for people trying to find which file they're supposed to edit

ec24f28 Don't save duplicate messages into a user's packed inbox. We've already got the packed box loaded at insert time, so we can simply unpack it and check before doing the update query. Should help with dupes that come in when inbox distrib jobs die and get restarted, etc.

ac9fda4 ProfileMiniListItem does same events as ProfileListItem
f1c01f9 Temporary hack until notice_profile_id_idx is updated to (profile_id, id) instead of (profile_id, created, id). It's been falling back to PRIMARY instead, which is really very inefficient for a profile that hasn't posted in a few months. Even though forcing the index will cause a filesort, it's usually going to be better. Even for large profiles it seems much faster than the badly-indexed query.

bd1363c Make stomp queue manager work with basic servers
a8d92da Renamed HTTPResponse class to StatusNet_HTTPResponse to avoid conflict with PECL HTTP extension. The class isn't referenced by name by any other code I can see so this should have no side effects.
d44e5ac Add $config['db']['annotate_queries'] option to include caller ID comments into queries. Comment can then be seen in process list, slow query logs on the server, aiding in tracking down unexpected slow queries.
