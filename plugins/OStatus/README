Plugin to support importing updates from external RSS and Atom feeds into your timeline.

Uses PubSubHubbub for push feed updates; currently non-PuSH feeds cannot be subscribed.

Configuration options available:

$config['ostatus']['hub']
    (default internal hub)
    Set to URL of an external PuSH hub to use it instead of our internal hub.

$config['ostatus']['hub_retries']
    (default 0)
    Number of times to retry a PuSH send to consumers if using internal hub


For testing, shouldn't be used in production:

$config['ostatus']['skip_signatures']
    (default use signatures)
    Disable generation and validation of Salmon magicenv signatures

$config['feedsub']['nohub']
    (default require hub)
    Allow low-level feed subscription setup for feeds without hubs.
    Not actually usable at this stage, OStatus will check for hubs too
    and we have no polling backend.


Todo:
* fully functional l10n
* redo non-OStatus feed support
** rssCloud support?
** possibly a polling daemon to support non-PuSH feeds?
* make use of tags/categories from feeds
