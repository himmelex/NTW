== TODO ==
* i18n
* Change in context URL to conversation (try not to construct the URL in JS)
* Update mark behaviour (on notice send)
* Pause, Send a notice ~ should not update counter
* Pause ~ retain up to 50-100 most recent notices
* Add geo data
* Make it work for Conversation page (perhaps a little tricky)
* IE is updating the counter in document title all the time (Not sure if this is still an issue)
* Reconsider the timestamp approach
